# üìò Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries

## üéØ Objective
Demonstrate the use of subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses using a sample `library` table.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Table Used: `library`

| BookID | Title                    | Author          | Genre         | Year | Copies |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|------|--------|
| 1      | The Alchemist            | Paulo Coelho     | Fiction        | 1988 | 5      |

## üîç Subquery Examples

### 1. üìå Subquery in `SELECT` (Scalar Subquery)
Shows each book along with total number of books in the table.

```sql
SELECT 
    Title, 
    Author, 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM library) AS TotalBooks
FROM library;
````

‚úÖ **Output:** Each row shows `TotalBooks = 5`.

---

### 2. üï∞Ô∏è Subquery in `WHERE` (Scalar)

Find books published in the **earliest year**.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM library
WHERE Year = (SELECT MIN(Year) FROM library);
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

* **The Hobbit** (1937)

---

### 3. üìö Subquery using `IN`

Find books where the genre appears more than once.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM library
WHERE Genre IN (
    SELECT Genre
    FROM library
    GROUP BY Genre
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
```

‚ùå **Output:** Empty set (no genre repeats in current data)

---

### 4. üìà Correlated Subquery

Find books that have more copies than the **average copies in their genre**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM library l1
WHERE Copies > (
    SELECT AVG(Copies)
    FROM library l2
    WHERE l1.Genre = l2.Genre
);
```

‚ùå **Output:** Empty set (each book is alone in its genre)

---

### 5. üìä Subquery in `FROM` (Derived Table)

Get genres with **total copies > 5**.

```sql
SELECT Genre, TotalCopies
FROM (
    SELECT Genre, SUM(Copies) AS TotalCopies
    FROM library
    GROUP BY Genre
) AS genre_summary
WHERE TotalCopies > 5;
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

* **Fantasy** ‚Üí 6 copies

---

### 6. üîÑ Subquery with `EXISTS`

Find books for which another book of the **same genre** exists.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM library l1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM library l2
    WHERE l1.Genre = l2.Genre AND l1.BookID <> l2.BookID
);
```

‚ùå **Output:** Empty set (no genre has more than 1 book)

---
